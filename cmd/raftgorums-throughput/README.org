* Raft Consensus with Gorums

** Throughput

  =raftgorums-throughput= measures a clusters throughput using the supplied arguments. The ip of the leader must be supplied with the =-leader= argument.
Failover in the case of a new leader is not implemented, as this client is only used to measure throughput under a stable leader.

*** Usage
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Usage of raftgorums-throughput:
  -clients int
    	Number of clients (default 1)
  -leader string
    	Leader server address
  -rate int
    	How often each client sends a request in microseconds (default 40)
  -time int
    	How long to measure in seconds
	time/2 seconds will be spent to saturate the cluster (default 30)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Example
After a cluster is started execute the following command and wait =2*time= seconds for the output.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
raftgorums-throughput -leader LEADERIP:9200
#+END_SRC
