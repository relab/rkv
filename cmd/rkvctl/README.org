* Raft Consensus with Gorums

** rkvctl
  =rkvctl= connects to a cluster through the =-cluster= argument. Running the
  client will start =-clients= connections, which will execute =32= insert
  requests each in parallel, then verify the inserts with =32= reads each. Each
  connection is synchronous, i.e., it waits for a response before sending a new
  request. If a client sends a requests to a follower, the request is forwarded
  to the leader. If the client can't connect to a server, it will try a new one
  at random from the cluster.

*** Usage
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Usage of rkvctl:
      -clients int
          number of clients (default 1)
      -cluster string
          comma separated cluster servers (default ":9201,:9202,:9203")
    #+END_EXAMPLE

*** Example
    After a cluster is started execute the following command and wait =2*time= seconds for the output.
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    rkvctl -clients 100
    #+END_SRC
